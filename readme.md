# DoinIt
## A todo list app built with SwiftUI

### Background
SwiftUI is currently in beta, and I couldn't wait to get stuck into it, so I started learning it by building a simple todo list app. This app.

### Using this code
Clone the repo and open the DointIt.xcodeproj. There are no third party libraries used, so no need to worry about installing pods or anything.
